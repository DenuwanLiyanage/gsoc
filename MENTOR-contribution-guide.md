# Contributing Guide for Mentors 
## Organizations Eligible Under ESIP Umbrella

To be eligible to participate in GSoC under the ESIP umbrella, any individual submitting an
idea must:

1. Be employed at a current ESIP member organization. 
2. Be willing to commit for the full GSoC period.
3. Be a willing and engaged mentor. 

You can submit ideas up to 3 days after Google announces that ESIP is
participating as a umbrella org.

When you submit your idea, please contact us (lab@esipfed.org) and tell us your preferred way for students
to contact you.

## Mentors Project Guidance 
### Projects

Please make sure that the project can be partly completed during the summer so
that students pass the final evaluation. Please also read
the [student guide](/STUDENT-contribution-guide.md), paying particular attention to what we require from students.

To ensure a project can be completed, we recommend as a guideline that the
project should be possible to complete by the mentor in about one week of full
time work. This doesn't sound like a lot of time but students generally take
much longer then a long-time developer. They have to get familiar with the code
and have to acquire a huge amount of domain knowledge.

There has to be at least one primary mentor and one backup mentor per project.
This means you should have at least 2 mentors available. A mentor can only be
'primary' for one student but a backup for as many as they like. 

If you have an idea you can use our [idea templates](https://github.com/ESIPFed/gsoc/blob/master/IDEA-template.md) and
publish the [issues page](https://github.com/ESIPFed/gsoc/issues) for this repo.
